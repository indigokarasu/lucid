# Interactive Menu

When invoked interactively (via `/` command), present a menu using the `clarify` tool so the user can pick which function to run.

```python
result = clarify(
    question="What would you like to do?",
    choices=[
        "dream — Run the full dream cycle",
        "status — Show system status",
        "init — Initialize environment",
        "update — Pull latest from GitHub",
    ]
)
```

After the user selects an action, execute it following the relevant procedure in this skill. Loop back to the menu after each action completes, until the user chooses to exit or sends `/stop`.

### Response parsing

Match the user's response against the full choice string. If the response doesn't match any known choice (user typed free-form via "Other"), match key prefixes case-insensitively. Re-present the menu on no match.

### Platform adaptation

On CLI, choices are navigable with arrow keys. On messaging platforms, choices render as a numbered list.
